<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Current social networks are based around producing as large and widely-distributed groups as possible. While this approach is great for remaining in contact with people all over the world and promoting your own social brand, it provides little value in increasing your quality of life on a day-to-day basis. MapChat aims to reverse this trend by promoting and maintaining a new form of hyper-local groups.

A hyper-local group means focusing on a small geographic area or around a well defined community. MapChat would create/maintain this new form of hyper-local groups by allowing the users to create a new community or join an existing one. The creation of a community is based on a geographical location. A community can be open for all or have restricted access, depending on the creator’s desires. Every group on the map can create their own flag. A popular group’s flag can be a marker for adventure, thereby leading other groups to explore a new community or attraction. Each flag is linked with a picture and brief description of the area written by the group. MapChat will also have a messaging system so the users can communicate and build a vibrant community. Ultimately, the purpose of MapChat is to encourage our users to get out and experience the world around them.


### Built With
MapChat will be hosted on AWS. Further technologies are still being discussed.
