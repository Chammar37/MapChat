# MapChat
Hyper-local social network

## Explanation of project

A lightweight social media network focused on map-groups and uploading pictures and short videos as flags to those groups. 

## What is a map-group?

A map-group is defined by a set of users and a map: users can document their activities and share moments at locations. 

## Social benefits

1. Getting outside to build a collection of images / videos / stories with friends

2. Similar to Pokemon GO in some sense, gives certain people a reason / reward to exercise or just go outside

3. Exploring locations in your home city / place you may not have been before

Example creative use: local neighbourhood map-group has flags for houses / places giving out halloween candy.

## Economic benefits

1. A town or city can have their own official map-group

2. Popular restaurants (or unpopular) could pay to have their restaurant as a flag

3. Tourist sites are marked by flags (monuments, points of interest)

4. Important city locations are flagged (public libraries, city hall, firehouse, post office . . )

5. Different layers for city

6. Restricted privileges for users

7. Time-sensitive offers appearing at different locations. 

## Environment

Mobile-app, desktop. (Prototype can run in a web browser)

## High-level Requirements


1. Users can sign up for an account through an account creation process.\
Priority: 1

2. Users can login through a login process.\
Priority: 1

3. Users can create a map-group by selecting a location.\
Priority: 1

4. Users can invite other users to join their own map-group.\
Priority: 1

5. Users with sufficient privileges can remove other users from a map group.\
Priority: 2

6. A map-group interface will have a chat box.\
Priority: 2

7. Users can upload a photo or video to a map-group (through mobile app), where it will appear as a flag for other users to interact with. Media has the coordinate meta data.\
Priority: 1

8. A user can choose to make the content of their flag hidden, requiring another user to visit the location in order to access the content.\
Priority: 2

9. A user can create a chain of flags meant to be visited in sequence, where each node unlocks the next successive node.\
Priority: 2

10. Users can select a flag in a map-group (mouse-click, touchscreen press), that will launch the picture or video for viewing.\
Priority: 1

11. Users can jump between different map-groups through a GUI.\
Priority : 1

12. Administrator users (those who created a map-group) can delegate group-member privileges: invitation, removal, chat-enabled, chat-muted\
Priority: 2

13. User can choose to display only certain layers of flags. e.g: choose to only see one other userâ€™s flags)\
Priority: 2

## Challenges 

Differentiating from other services: this is very similar to Google My Maps

1. Come up with some way to incentivize people going outside

2. Strip down the features of My Maps to make it simpler to use

3. Lean on the social media or game aspect of it more.  

Map generation: This can be a blackbox in the prototype, but could be necessary to design.

1. Handcraft maps for major cities (New York, Tokyo, Delhi . .), or start with Ontario and do the major cities. probably not feasible

2. Basic Custom map generation: scrape google maps or another service, take a static snapshot from the map

3. Third party software or service: connect it to the system as a component

4. Develop more advanced map generation

High volume of users

## Priorities

1 = Essential\
2 = Important\
3 = Desirable, not completely necessary

Priority 1 items must be implemented for the system to operate.

Priority 2 items should be implemented, but can be leveraged if needed, and the system will still function.

Priority 3 items can be absent, but would be nice to have and would improve the product.

## Architecture styles

Model-view-controller
