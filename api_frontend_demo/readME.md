to test it out

1. download the files
2. edit in a working API key in the google api dependency url (inside the html file)
3. launch the html file in your browser
4. Click the choose file button and upload the mushroom picture (it has coordinates near the hardcoded origin)
5. Click post button and it should load the mushroom at its location with the pic

note: in the PDF I have written out an explanation of what the code does, 
and some notes about what we still need in terms of API calls, and how/where those API 
calls will be used in the front end for the mapgroup
